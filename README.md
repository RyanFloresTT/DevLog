## How to Use DevLog

1. **Create a Project:** Start by creating a project you're working on.
2. **Start a Session:** When you sit down to work, start a session and provide some opening notes.
3. **Log Progress:** Head back to the app every so often to give context on what you're working on at the time, and if anything is stumping you.
4. **Close the Session:** When it's time to pack up, close out the session by leaving some closing notes.
5. **Export Your Work:** Export your sessions individually, or all together as one big `.md` file to kickstart your blog!
